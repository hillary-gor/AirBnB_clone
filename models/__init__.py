from models.engine.file_storage import FileStorage


storage = FileStorage()
storage.reload()




explanation
Initialize a FileStorage instance for managing data within the AirBnB/models/engine directory. Intention is to set up data storage functionality using the FileStorage class and ensure that the storage is reloaded or updated as needed. The specific details of what the FileStorage class does and how it's used would likely be defined in the models.engine.file_storage module.
